My first steps on QA + TestNg + Maven + Selenium 

<h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
<p>In the field of software development, the acronym QA stands for Quality Assurance, or quality assurance. It is a set of evaluation activities of the different stages of the development process to ensure that the final product is of quality. The concept of quality lends itself to multiple interpretations, but always implies that the software meets the needs of the client.</p>
  
<p>Beyond the differences, a good QA plan can not ignore the importance of the standards. By this we mean written and unambiguous rules about the product's objectives, the design and follow-up methodologies and conventions necessary to guide the programmers' tasks (coding styles, data structures, etc.).</p>

<p>The QA plan goes through the development process from the birth of the idea to the implementation of the software. In the early stages, verify that the objectives are well planned and the requirements are accurate. In the design and coding phases, it monitors compliance with the set standards. Finally, check that the software in operation complies with the requested requirements and that the delivery to the client is made in the appropriate conditions.</p>

<p>The QA is based on a set of quality tests, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit testing: it is proved that each module works well separately.</li>
<li>Stress test: the resistance of the application is tested by sending an excessive amount of requests, looking for it to collapse.</li>
<li>Integration test: the modules tested independently during the unit test are coupled and tested together.</li>
<li>Functional test: it is proved that the software offers the requested functions.</li>
<li>Acceptance test: the user verifies that the product meets their expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The QA tests are not only beneficial for the end user, who will receive a quality product, but also for the development team, which by establishing permanent control over the process will largely avoid the costs of having to correct errors in stages advanced of the project. </p>
